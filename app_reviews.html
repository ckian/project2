Did well at first and then fell like a stone.</td></tr>", "<tr><td>http://appshopper.com/photography/photo55</td><td>Photo55</td><td>Recreates functionality available in apps such as Camera+ but at the same price lacking all other features. Pointless app.</td></tr>", "<tr><td>http://appshopper.com/productivity/ipasssafe</td><td>Password Safe - iPassSafe</td><td>There are better, cheaper, apps out there. No real appeal.</td></tr>", "<tr><td>http://appshopper.com/utilities/alarm-clock-rio</td><td>Alarm Clock Rio</td><td>Pointless app, only has functionality that is already included in IOS and it costs money.</td></tr>"]
