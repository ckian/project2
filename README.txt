This is the second project submission by Chris Kian for CINS 465 Fall 2001.

The most important part of this readme is to notify the user how to run the program.  Although the instuctions are :


	$./app_review.rb reviews
	generated reviews!


, my program works with the following :


	$ruby app_review.rb reviews
	generated reviews!


This is also assuming 'reviews' is a folder with .yml files in it, not a .tar file with .yml files in it.  Thank you for reading this file, I hope it helps whomever uses it to get my program working.
